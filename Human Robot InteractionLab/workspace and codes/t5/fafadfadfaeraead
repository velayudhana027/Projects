u:(_[1 2 3]) $number=$1 Roger sir.

u:(_[cycle car]) Copy that sir. To confirm you want to go to $destination by $1 is that correct

u: (yes buddy) Got it. Go straight to the cafeteria entrance road. Take left and ride 1km and take right. You would be in your destination by 20 mins.
u: (no) oh ok. you need help?
